# NerdTest
Private repo for the Nerdery Assessmet Test - Backend for Java



Hello! Thank you for taking a look at my submission for the nerd assessment test. This is a full web application
complete with a user interface and back end. I was assigned the task of developing a web application that can tell
the user how man coins of each value (silver dollar, half dollar, quarter, dime, nickel, penny) comprise a dollar 
amount given by the user. I wanted to keep the project professional and simple, with emphasis on developing 
an application with scalability and ease of maintenance in mind. Also, given the nature of this project, the JavaDoc 
expands more in depth upon design choices, etc. than typical, to give the reader a close understanding of my thoughts
 and actions while developing. Here are some details about the technology stack used in this project:
 
 * A Java back end utilizing Spring Boot MVC Framework
 
 * A user interface developed in Angular 7, complete with data services
 
 * User interface styling is accomplished with the Angular Material toolset
 
 # How to run this project locally
 
 First and foremost, esure you have the proper technology installed. This includes:
 
 * Java 1.8
 
 * Node 6.10.xx or greater
 
 * Angular CLI 8.2.3 or greater (some older vrsions may be forward compatible to run the project)
 
 Once the project is cloned, navigate to the root folder of the user interface: "NerdTest\frontend\changeApp"
 and initialize & update node using the following commands:
 
 >npm init
 
 >npm update
 
 Once node is updated you can build and open the user interface
 project using the following commands:
 
 >ng build
 
 >ng serve --open
 
 Once the user interface is running, you may open the java portion from the project root in your favorite IDE, and
 execute the Gradle build and bootrun tasks to launch the Spring Boot MVC server .JAR.
 
 *note:If you run into issues building and running the Angular project, you may need to install the Angular devkit.
 
 Congratulations! You are now running my project. Feel free to poke around. :)
